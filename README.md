# Please see [Our Documentation](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) for more in-depth installation etc.

* kind
  * ðŸ‘€ == tool for running -- via Docker container "nodes" -- local Kubernetes clusters ðŸ‘€
    * each "node" -- is bootstrapped with -- [kubeadm][kubeadm]
  * origin
    * testing Kubernetes itself
  * uses 
    * local development
    * CI
  * == 
    * Go [packages][packages] / implement [cluster creation][cluster package], [image build][build package], etc + 
    * CL interface ([`kind`][kind cli]) / built | previous packages +
    * Docker [image(s)][images] / run systemd, Kubernetes, etc +
    * [`kubetest`][kubetest] integration / built | previous packages (WIP)
  * WIP
    * see the [1.0 roadmap]

## Installation and usage

* fast
  * installation
    * if you have installed [go] 1.16+ -> run `go install sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.25.0`
  * usage
    * if you have [docker], [podman] or [nerdctl] installed -> run `kind create cluster`

![](site/static/images/kind-create-cluster.png)

* see complete [install guide]

* TODO:
**NOTE**: please use the latest go to do this. KIND is developed with the latest stable go, see [`.go-version`](./.go-version) for the exact version we're using.

This will put `kind` in `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`. If you encounter the error
`kind: command not found` after installation then you may need to either add that directory to your `$PATH` as
shown [here](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) or do a manual installation by cloning the repo and run
`make build` from the repository.

Without installing go, kind can be built reproducibly with docker using `make build`.

Stable binaries are also available on the [releases] page. Stable releases are
generally recommended for CI usage in particular.
To install, download the binary for your platform from "Assets" and place this
into your `$PATH`:

On Linux:

```console
# For AMD64 / x86_64
[ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] && curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.25.0/kind-$(uname)-amd64
# For ARM64
[ $(uname -m) = aarch64 ] && curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.25.0/kind-$(uname)-arm64
chmod +x ./kind
sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind
```

On macOS via Homebrew:

```console
brew install kind
```

On macOS via MacPorts:

```console
sudo port selfupdate && sudo port install kind
```

On macOS via Bash:

```console
# For Intel Macs
[ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] && curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.25.0/kind-darwin-amd64
# For M1 / ARM Macs
[ $(uname -m) = arm64 ] && curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.25.0/kind-darwin-arm64
chmod +x ./kind
mv ./kind /some-dir-in-your-PATH/kind
```

On Windows:

```powershell
curl.exe -Lo kind-windows-amd64.exe https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.25.0/kind-windows-amd64
Move-Item .\kind-windows-amd64.exe c:\some-dir-in-your-PATH\kind.exe

# OR via Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/packages/kind)
choco install kind
```

To use kind, you will need to [install docker].
Once you have docker running you can create a cluster with:

```console
kind create cluster
```

To delete your cluster use:

```console
kind delete cluster
```

<!--TODO(bentheelder): improve this part of the guide-->
To create a cluster from Kubernetes source:
- ensure that Kubernetes is cloned in `$(go env GOPATH)/src/k8s.io/kubernetes`
- build a node image and create a cluster with:
```console
kind build node-image
kind create cluster --image kindest/node:latest
```

Multi-node clusters and other advanced features may be configured with a config
file, for more usage see [the docs][user guide] or run `kind [command] --help`

## Why kind?

- supports
  - multi-node (including HA) clusters
  - building Kubernetes release / -- builds from -- source
    - support for make / bash or docker, in addition to pre-published builds
  - Linux, macOS and Windows
- [CNCF certified conformant Kubernetes installer](https://landscape.cncf.io/?selected=kind)
- NOT require an additional VM
  - Reason: ðŸ§  runs as a linux container /
    - has a set of processes
    - Linux kernel used == Linux kernel -- used by -- Docker daemon 
  - ðŸ‘€!= local installation of Minikube or MinishiftðŸ‘€
    - Kubernetes cluster is started | VM
      - == run a Linux kernel + Docker daemon -> consume EXTRA CPU and RAM
        - -> kind is faster & consumes less CPU and RAM
